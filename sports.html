            >Volleyball is a sport where two teams of six players use their
            hands to hit a ball back and forth over a net.</em

        <h3>
          The goal is to hit the ball into the other team's court without
          letting it touch the ground. Here are some facts about volleyball.
        </h3>
        <p>
          The game starts with a coin toss to determine which team serves first.
          The server hits the ball over the net from behind the baseline. The
          receiving team has three hits to return the ball over the net. The
          rally continues until a team wins by grounding the ball in the
          opponent's court or the other team commits a fault. The winning team
          scores a point and serves the ball next.

            >Soccer is a team sport where two teams of 11 players compete to
            score goals by moving the ball into the opponent's goal with their

          The game is divided into two 45-minute halves and is controlled by a
          referee and two linesmen. A goal is scored when the ball crosses the
          goal line.
        </h3>
        <p>
          The origins of soccer can be traced back over 2,000 years to ancient
          China, Greece, and Rome. However, the modern version of the game
          originated in 19th century England. The first modern soccer game was
          played in London in 1863.

          The goal is to hit the ball in a way that the opponent can't return
          it, scoring points.
        </h3>
        <p>
          Tennis originated in Britain in the 1870s from earlier games that used
          rackets and balls. The first world lawn tennis championship was held
          in 1877 at Wimbledon.
