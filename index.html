          Plastic Pollution Treaty Talks
        </h2>

          <em>Nations are deciding what actions they’ll take</em>

        <p class="w-300 m-auto">
          National delegations still have a lot to hammer out before there is a
          treaty. Most contentious is whether there will be a limit on the
          amount of plastic that companies are allowed to produce. Led by Norway
          and Rwanda, 66 countries plus the European Union say they want to
          address the total plastic on Earth by controlling plastic design,
          production, consumption and what happens at the end of its life. Some
          plastic-producing and oil and gas countries, including Saudi Arabia,
          vigorously oppose such limits. Global plastics production is set to
          reach 736 million tons by 2040, up 70% from 2020, without policy
          changes, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and
          Development.

          WELLINGTON, New Zealand — More than 30 pilot whales that stranded
          themselves on a beach in New Zealand were safely returned to the ocean
          after conservation workers and residents helped to refloat them by
          lifting them on sheets. Four of the pilot whales died, New Zealand's
          conservation agency said.
